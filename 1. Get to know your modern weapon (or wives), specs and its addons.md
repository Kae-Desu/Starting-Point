Have you heard of a saying.
> Every Soldier Needs a Weapon

no? so do i, i made these term because IT workers is more or less the same as soldier but instead of working directly doing things, most of them only work behind the scene making things and such.
thus one question comes to mind

do you know what is this?
a computer? a PC? yes you're correct, who says other than this and even CPU (indonesian call this CPU even the professional). need to refresh their common sense.\
this is a PC or well-known as a Computer (a unit that computes). anyway this is IT workers main weapon, and before you ask.. no.. i do not own the one as fancy as the above. your weapon could be as fancy as those or just as simple as this.
