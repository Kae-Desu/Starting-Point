# 2. Get to know your modern weapon (or wives) specs
in the last module we've been talking about our weapon and wives which is a laptop or a PC, but everything has its own limit, and its wise to know how our weapon works and knowing our wives specs.
our wives, althought is very intelligent they also poses some limitation such as small brained and some may only a medium brained, how would you know about your wives if you dont know what is your wives and weapon made of. this part will cover most of it. lesgooo!!!

first of all, what is a specification or specs in short?\
specification is a detailed information about stuffs, lets say theres a job specification such as 1 - 3 years of working experience in related field. same work for PC and laptops, they comes with specification which you could choose (laptop) or determine (PC).

why we choose specification on laptop and determine the specification on PC?\
because laptop is build by a manufacturer, you cant just "i dont like this part, imma unsolder this and change it into others". its built-in so you cant do much, and most manufacturer always giving some upgrade options like a free RAM slot or sata slot. on the other hands.
PC got 2 options either you buy manufactures made or you build it yourself. building it yourself is much more cheaper and sometimes cheaper than a laptop with the same or even slightly better specs.

before we start i would like to remind you.\
PC and laptop part has the same name and functionality ***BUT*** **most of them is different in size, laptop part will fit with other laptops, and pc part will fit with other pc part**\
this doesnt matter tbh since i will shows both of the items, but in case you're a haste reader.

without further ado... meet Parts and Components
### MotherBoard
as said in its name, motherboard is a mother who hold all her kids, in this case its each part of the components, here's what it looks like (photo borrowed from internet)

as you can see, desktop or a PC motherboard has a noticeable square form while laptop got a randomly weird form, both function the same to house the part, the key difference is that laptop motherboard got more electrical part in it since its working with both AC and DC (batteries) electric, while desktop only work from AC power.\
this is what a PC motherboard looks like.\
