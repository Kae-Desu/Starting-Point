# Some useful information and note
A brief introduction
========
If you're reading this that means you seek knowledge of how to enter the world of IT or simply finding a reference or sharpen your skills especially in Cyber Security. Let me introduce myself.\
I call myself Kae or Kei (pronounced like Key), and currently a Student at one of well-known (limited to local) Indonesian university. Majoring in Cyber Security. it's one of the reason why this repo would most-likely point to Cyber Security Careers. To be honest, i made this repo because im tired of teaching each individual i met who got interest in the path of Cyber Security, with this repo being made i could promote my github and teach people at the same time, well atleast they got the resource and i could guide them base on that. Dont be mad, im not good at putting a sugar to words and tend to be striaght forward. and i could ended up putting "whatever it is" in some material. i'm rlly sorry for that. 

Motivational Quotes LOL
========
i once attend a church near my place, they played a beautiful music, and the important point is the topic of the moral speech, the pastors says something like (if i remember correctly) "if you're hurt then you're the best person to tell the message to others". this doesnt only include physical hurt (bleeding, scratch, etc) it also include experience of an act which represent like "i have ever experienced it once, then i know more than you, therefore i warn you about what i experienced". im no religious actors, ofc i cant tell it the way that pastor did, but i hope you get the idea.

DISCLAIMER!!
=======
This repo is indeed created by a Cyber Security enthusiast, so this obviously will point to Cyber Security of course. But it is not limited to:
- System Administrator
- DevOps Engineer
- Network Administrator
- Cloud Engineer, and
- Data Scientist / Analyst

<h3>It's really recommended to take a note on everything you've learn, in case this repo is down, or ded, or takendown, or github got hacked, or even your Provider tower got burnt (happen once in indonesia)</h3>

All images i used might be a self-drawn or "borrowed" from internet and all credit goes to it's repective owner (except my hand drawn images)

This repo is an ongoing project and i would love a feedback and such to build a dependable curriculum for people ranging from self-taught who seeks knowledge to Professionals who seeks to sharpen their basic skills. in this time and era limitation of having a not-too-good financial, isn't an excuse to stop learning and giveup about lives. i want to contribute in building a cyberspace which is better and safe (its just an exaggeration we know that to changed the world it takes way too much work and times. all we can do is to change things around us).\

TOPICS
=======
This repo will covers these topics:
1. Get to know your modern weapon (or wives), specs and its addons - an article i made covering all about the modern weapon, the backbone, and support system of IT workers.
2. os?Os?oS? OS! - an article about OSes, the second most important aspect, after all a modern weapon runs on electricity and needs something to make thing runs.\
   include: linux trivials!!
4. i-i-internet? - an article covering about network protocol, networking(internet not social) is one of the key component in IT.
5. i will ~~leave~~ aid you to prepare - an article about preparing your environment to learn or anything, its just a simple installing VM tutorial to be honest.
6. as long as it works - an article about linux and windows command line, terminal is the front most weapon in the arsenal (for linux), it could do anything from stupid things to breaking some things\
   include: practice materials!!
7. program? binary? huh? - an article covering linux and windows executeable and a ~~long~~ simple programming in C (until pointers MWAHHAHAH), starguest: python, go and rust (wont go too far, only a brief overview)\
   include: test case!!
8. what now? - you've look S-IT-lish, an article of further prospect of career since i will only covers Cyber Security, i could reccomend some to do things.
9. MORE UPCOMING, AFTER THE ABOVE MATERIAL IS DONE.

FAQ
=======
1. why a student would made a curriculum which no one knows the validity or it's effectiveness?\
i personally admit that im inexperienced, but i've made clear of this point to look at:
- I've been a security enthusiast since im in the Middle school, and i learn the __hard way__ to become what i am today and im still actively learning and interacting with cyber security world itself, and im planning to make this learning process easier (you don't have to suffer like i did, i clear the way and you just need to use it).
- During my first year at university i met with much new person and other people on the internet which interested in learning "hacking" but have no idea where to start, watching videos on youtube and start randomly defacing websites (this is a great way to learn but it's unethical and lower the respect to the local hacker community), and so i've been actively teaching a small group and made a small community of people with like-minded interest, during teaching i re-learn the material used for teaching and keep revising it manually. and i think the current version is the current most effective way to learn.
- It might not be much but im a CEH certified, being a CEH certified mean i've been seriously pursuing the world of Cyber Security and have been acknowledged by an amount of people. and i will contribute my part in this Cyber related world.

2. my vision\
   i have only one vision. a better internet world for people and for me. and i have a mission, i will realise my vision using any method possible. dont take me as a criminal-minded its just how i think.

3. will there be translation?\
   i might consider it in the future, since google translate getting much more better at translating than i do, but for now it will be in english as it's an international language.
   
4. will the resource listed here FREE or PAID\
   to be honest, i expect you to be fine with a little amount of money (about 10US$+) for a better future investment, rather than the money goes to games and gain nothing in the future (also learned the hard way).
